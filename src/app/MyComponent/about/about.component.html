                    <p class="card-text">This app serves the purpose to keep a list of anything you want. We can create
                        a new list, add more lists, mark the lists whose work is done, and also delete them. The lists
                        are stored in your local browser, so that even if you close the tab and revisit the webpage you
                        can still get your saved lists backs. We introduced another feather called 'checkbox' or 'Done'
                        so when you are done with a list you can mark that list as Done and it will strike that list and
                        still keep it saved so that you can keep a reference that this work is completed.
