# MarketList

This app serves the purpose to keep a list of anything you want. We can create a new list, add more lists, mark the lists whoes work is done and also delete them. The lists are stored in the your local browser, so that even if you close the tab and revisit the webpage you can still get your saved lists backs. We introduced another feather called 'checkbox' or 'Done' so when you are done with a list you can mark that list as Done and it will strike that lists and still keep it saved, so that you can keep a reference that this work is done.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.
