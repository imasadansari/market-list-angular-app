# MarketList

This app serves the purpose to keep a list of anything you want. We can create a new list, add more lists, mark the lists whose work is done, and also delete them. The lists are stored in your local browser, so that even if you close the tab and revisit the webpage you can still get your saved lists backs. We introduced another feather called 'checkbox' or 'Done' so when you are done with a list you can mark that list as Done and it will strike that list and still keep it saved so that you can keep a reference that this work is completed.
